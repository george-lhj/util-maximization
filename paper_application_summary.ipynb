    "# Utility Maximization in Incomplete Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a plain–language summary of the paper *Utility Maximization in Incomplete Markets* by Hu, Imkeller, and Müller. It covers the market model, the BSDE approach, and the derivation of optimal trading strategies for various utility functions. All the key mathematical expressions are rendered using the `$$ ... $$` syntax."

    "## 1. Overview and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Main Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper studies how a small investor can maximize their expected utility—i.e., the satisfaction from the final wealth—in a market that is **incomplete** (where not all risks can be hedged) and under practical trading restrictions. These restrictions are modeled by requiring that the trading strategies lie in a closed set (which is a more general assumption than convexity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utility Functions Covered:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential Utility:**  \n",
    "  $$ U(x) = -\\exp(-\\alpha x) $$  \n",
    "  (constant absolute risk aversion).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power Utility:**  \n",
    "  $$ U(x) = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\, x^\\gamma, \\quad x > 0, \\quad \\gamma \\in (0,1) $$  \n",
    "  (relative risk aversion).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logarithmic Utility:**  \n",
    "  $$ U(x) = \\log(x), \\quad x > 0 $$  \n",
    "  (a special case of power utility).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper offers a unified method—based on backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs)—to directly determine both the maximum expected utility (the \"value function\") and the corresponding optimal trading strategy even when the market is incomplete and the constraints are non–convex (they are only assumed to be closed)."

    "## 2. Market Setup and Trading Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The market consists of at least one riskless bond (with zero interest rate) and \\( d \\) stocks whose prices follow stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion.\n",
    "- Because there are more sources of uncertainty than tradable assets, the market is **incomplete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trading Strategies and Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A trading strategy is a rule for investing in each asset at any time, based only on available (past and present) information.\n",
    "- Strategies are required to belong to a closed set \\( \\tilde{C} \\); this models practical limits like restrictions on short selling or maximum exposure.\n",
    "- The closed nature of the set ensures that the projection (finding the closest admissible strategy) is well defined."

    "## 3. Methodology: Using BSDEs for Utility Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of employing duality techniques, the authors solve the \"primal\" problem directly by constructing a process \\( R \\) for each trading strategy. The main idea is to design \\( R \\) so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its terminal value equals the utility of the final wealth (or \\( X_T - F \\) in the exponential case),\n",
    "- Its initial value is constant (and does not depend on the strategy) and represents the maximal expected utility (the value function), and\n",
    "- It is a **supermartingale** for every admissible strategy but becomes a **martingale** when the optimal strategy is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process \\( R \\) is built by combining the wealth process \\( X \\) with an auxiliary process \\( Y \\) obtained as the solution to a BSDE of the form:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the driver function \\( f(s, Z_s) \\) is chosen to enforce the desired supermartingale properties. The optimal trading strategy is derived by projecting an unconstrained candidate (involving \\( Z_t \\) and the market price of risk \\( \\theta_t \\)) onto the constraint set."

    "## 7. Practical Steps for Application\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the methods from the paper in practice, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Market Modeling:**\n",
    "   - Define the stochastic dynamics for the stocks (drift \\(b_t\\) and volatility \\(\\sigma_t\\)).\n",
    "   - Compute the market price of risk \\(\\theta_t\\) from these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Constraints:**\n",
    "   - Specify the allowable strategy set \\(\\tilde{C}\\).\n",
    "   - Transform this into the time–dependent set \\(C_t\\) (using the volatility matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select a Utility Function:**\n",
    "   - Choose exponential, power, or logarithmic utility based on the risk preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Up the BSDE:**\n",
    "   - Formulate the BSDE for \\(Y_t\\) (and the accompanying process \\(Z_t\\)).\n",
    "     - For **exponential utility** the terminal condition includes the liability \\(F\\).\n",
    "     - For **power** and **logarithmic utility** the terminal condition is typically zero.\n",
    "   - Use the corresponding driver function \\( f(s,z) \\) as given above.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Solve the BSDE:**\n",
    "   - Use analytical or numerical methods to compute \\( (Y_t, Z_t) \\). The initial value \\( Y_0 \\) directly adjusts the value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Determine the Optimal Strategy:**\n",
    "   - For exponential utility:  \n",
    "     $$ p^*_t \\in \\Pi\\Bigl(Z_t + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\theta_t,\\, C_t\\Bigr). $$\n",
    "   - For power utility:  \n",
    "     $$ \\rho^*_t \\in \\Pi\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}(Z_t + \\theta_t),\\, C_t\\Bigr). $$\n",
    "   - For logarithmic utility:  \n",
    "     $$ \\rho^*_t \\in \\Pi\\Bigl(\\theta_t,\\, C_t\\Bigr). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dynamic Consistency:**\n",
    "   - The method satisfies the dynamic programming principle, so if you re–solve the problem with updated information, the same strategy is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Implementation:**\n",
    "   - Depending on your needs, implement numerical methods to solve the BSDE and carry out the projection onto \\(C_t\\).\n",
    "   - This framework is robust even when the constraint set is non–convex (only closedness is needed)."
